ðŸ“¢ How useful is a website if it cannot be updated?

Without a content management system that's difficult. I work with a wide variety of set-ups. I have extensive knowledge of WordPress & Gutenberg development. Iâ€™m also proficient in PHP, and HTML & JavaScript template languages and alternative 'serverless' solutions.

WordPress is often the go-to platform because of its undeniable legacy. I've been writing themes and plugins since practically the beginning. The new Gutenberg editor combined with the right [front-end development](/front-end-development/) skillset provides a powerfully modern CMS experience. Even in 'headless' mode.

Tempted to utilise something truly cutting-edge? I'll happily embrace modern web frameworks with build and deployment systems.

While I'm not a back-end programmer,Â for the right project I can deliver an all-in-one solution (or otherwise, work with a team to do so).

ðŸ’¤ [My services](/services/) also include: [front-end development](/front-end-development/),  [responsive design](/responsive-design/), and [process & strategy](/process-and-strategy/).
