2020 started on a positive note for me. [I blogged again](/2020/01/10/blogging-in-2020/) after a yearlong hiatus. I guess I'd lost my web mojo in 2019. Too much Twitter can have that effect.

Sometime in February on the bus to the gym I read about the Coronavirus. I pulled my scarf up around my airways and let go of the handrails. I have good balance and strong knees thanks to the [DLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docklands_Light_Railway) (which is technically a rollercoaster).

Buying a bench, rack, and weights in late 2019 proved to be a moment of genius precognition. That kept my Zoom background game on point.

I got an espresso machine too. It's paid for itself.

That's my 2020 year in review.

I basically did nothing else of interest. Kept my head down locked in my flat. Had food delivered. Ordered too much takeaway. Only went outside to run â€” until I pulled my hamstring. I think that's mended and I'm tentatively running again. Now with more ice to contend with. I also put 200 odd hours into [Ring Fit Adventure](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ring-fit-adventure-switch/).

A lot of exercise is a good way to keep busy, sane, and motivated.

## 2021 in Review?

Might as well write this early as I don't foresee any change soon! I have some client work to keep me going. Business related projects are on hold, obviously. I'm glad I reconsidered renting office space. That would have been a costly mistake.

I want to focus on more personal projects this year. And smaller, more frequent blog posts. I've a big update on my [self hosted](/2020/07/02/hardware-home-servers-self-hosted-raspberry-pi/) experiments to pen. Maybe I'll do that as a series to keep it manageable.

ðŸ’ªðŸ˜· Stay strong.
