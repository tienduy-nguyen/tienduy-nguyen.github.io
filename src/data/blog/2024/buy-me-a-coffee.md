I'm trying something new this year. In exchange for over a decade of continued [blogging](/blog/) and [open source](https://github.com/tduyng/) content I'm asking for a little something in return.

<a class="Image Image--basic"
  href="/tip/"
  rel="me noopener noreferrer"
  target="_blank">
  <img
    loading="lazy"
    fetchpriority="low"
    src="/images/blog/2024/kofi_tag.png"
    alt="Support me on Ko-fi"
    width="170"
    height="65">
</a>

Head over to [**ko-fi.com/tduyng**](https://ko-fi.com/tduyng) and show support with a small tip.

Tipping is entirely optional, of course! This blog will remain free. I don't believe adding a hard paywall would benefit anyone. If you've found my [blog](/blog/), [code](https://github.com/tduyng/), or anything else I publish enjoyable, helpful, or valuable in any way, please consider a bit of financial support.

## Why Ko-fi?

I will trial Ko-fi for the foreseeable future. It seems like an overall good platform. Ko-fi allows for both one-off and monthly payments using either PayPal or Stripe. The user experience for supporters is quick and easy. There are options for membership and commissions which I may explore later.

So please consider supporting and I'll continue delivering quality content and code. I have a lot planned for 2024. I hope the various links across my profiles are not too obnoxious! Surely they're better than ads.

### Thank you!

[Tipping me on Ko-fi](/tip/) guarantees nothing in return â€” but it is greatly appreciated! Tips are intended to show your unconditional support and are not payments for a product or service. However, if you want a refund, please contact me via the payment processor.

Many thanks!
