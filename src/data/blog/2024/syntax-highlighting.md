I've been using [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) to highlight syntax on my blog. I achieved this with a custom plugin for [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). This was kinda janky for my [server-side build process](/2024/02/14/super-fast-builds/). Prism is old. [Prism v2](https://github.com/orgs/PrismJS/discussions/3531) doesn't seem to be happening. You've served me well, Prism, but it's time to go.


I tried [Highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) writing documentation for [ssr.rocks](https://ssr.rocks/). It's better, but it's not the amazing syntax highlighter I'm after. I want something truely modern.

## Something Modern

I discovered [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) once before but February this year saw the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/releases/tag/v1.0.0) with major improvements. Shiki uses the same engine that powers VS Code. I think it might be exactly what I'm looking for. It only took an hour to retrofit Shiki into my website.

### Pros

* Easy to use ES module exports
* Actively maintained and improved
* More variation in syntax tokens and themes
* Documentation <sup>â€ </sup>

### Cons

* Slower startup due to WASM
* Inline styles; no classes
* Documentation <sup>â€ </sup>

Slower I can live with. It takes under two seconds to parse all the code blocks in my 400+ articles. With Prism that was under 500ms (but it did less).

Inline styles I can't live with.

ðŸ’¤ <sup>â€ </sup> Superb effort on the docs but they're missing a basic API overview; what does the module export? I find that so useful without the marketing fluff and slow hand-holding intros.

## Wrestling Styles

My website uses [content security headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src). Every inline style element or attribute requires a cryptographic hash. It's not practical to generate CSP hashes for every attribute. I could use the `unsafe-inline` header but that defeats the purpose.

My static site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages which is [limited to 100 headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/). Even with a server-side framework, generating a unique header per blog post would be a pain with tens or potentially hundreds of hashes.

### Undeterred

My solution is to strip out inline styles after the syntax highlighter has done its job. I generate a class for each unique style starting at `syntax-0`. I then replace the style attribute with the class attribute.

Something like this:

```javascript
const cssMap = new Map();
const styleAttr = /style=(["'])(.*?)\1/g;

const stripStyles = (code) => {
  return code.replace(styleAttr, (...args) => {
    if (!cssMap.has(args[2])) {
      cssMap.set(args[2], `syntax-${cssMap.size}`);
    }
    return `class="${cssMap.get(args[2])}"`;
  });
};
```

This CSS map is maintained across all pages as their markdown is rendered. The end result for my blog is 18 unique classes. From that I generate a single stylesheet and CSP hash I can add to every page. It's only 675 bytes of extra CSS.

```javascript
let css = [...cssMap.entries()]
  .map(([k, v]) => `.${v}{${k};}`)
  .join('');
css = `@layer syntax{${css}}`;
```

I've effectively generated a theme stylesheet like the other syntax highlighters use. Below is an example output I've formatted with whitespace:

```css
@layer syntax {
  .syntax-1 {
    color: #ff79c6;
  }
  .syntax-2 {
    color:#F8F8F2;
  }
  /* 3 through 17 skipped... */
  .syntax-18 {
    color: #ffb86c;
  }
}
```

On top of this I've added additional styles for:

* Line numbers
* Alternating line backgrounds
* Visible whitespace characters
* A tiny language tag

I'm only adding line numbers for 3+ lines of code. Using the `:has()` pseudo-class makes it super easy to do "quantity queries".

```css
pre:has(:nth-child(3 of .line)) {
  /* Add line numbers with CSS counter */
}
```

Shiki is not perfect. Did you spot the highlighting mistake in the code above? Same issue appears in VS Code too because they use the same engine. I've noticed a lot of modern CSS syntax gets messed up, especially when nesting is involved.

Maybe if you're reading this from the future the bug was fixed. Sorry (not sorry). Here's a screenshot with a red squiggly:

<figure class="Image">
  <img
    loading="lazy"
    decoding="async"
    fetchpriority="low"
    src="/images/blog/2024/shiki-highlight-error.avif"
    alt="code with syntax highlighting error underlined"
    width="429"
    height="97">
</figure>

Anyway, I think this is still a major improvement to my blog.

Maintaining accessible colour contrast is difficult with syntax highlighters. Most themes fail WCAG guidelines. I'm using "Dracula" as a base. I modified a few colours to bump contrast above the 4.5:1 ratio. Red still fails but I think it's only used for a few rare symbols.

```javascript
const code = await shiki.codeToHtml(token.text, {
  lang: token.lang,
  theme: 'dracula',
  colorReplacements: {
    '#6272a4': '#a3b5eb', // Grey
    '#ff79c6': '#ff93ce', // Pink
    '#bd93f9': '#caa7ff', // Purple
  }
});
```
