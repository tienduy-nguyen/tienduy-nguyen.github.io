To showcase a large product catalogue it is crucial to shape the website design around the necessary content. Flexible levels of navigation are used to present a clear content hierarchy.

The **Peerless** design achieves this by giving the visitor the right choices where needed, and does so consistently across the website.

The style is reminiscentÂ of the professional, high quality products. The home page provides a great introduction using the interactive carousel.
