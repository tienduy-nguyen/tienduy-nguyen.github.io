TheÂ **Eden Anglo French** website has a modern design both in aesthetics and interaction.Â Making use of both JavaScript and Flash in close unison can produce a dynamic and accessible website design.

The wood veneer gallery is a powerful solution to showcase hundreds of products with a simple and elegant interface.

The green and brown colour theme complements the natural wood photography, the orange adds a sharp but harmonious contrast.
