title: 'Tamed Aggression'
---
Tamed Aggression was a collaborated art direction piece between myself and photographer Claire Storr.

The fashion shoot follows the theme of “a day in the life of a riot police officer” and incorporates real life police equipment and props created by me. The typefaces have been carefully chosen to sit alongside and interact with the photography.
