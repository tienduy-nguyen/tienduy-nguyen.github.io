Taking full advantage of the screen available is often a fight between aesthetics and usability, not to mention the technical challenge. **Atherton Cox** combines fixed and fluid elements that look great in a wide array of screen resolutions.

The style mimics that of the salons interior and makes maximum use of the professional photography provided by the client. Content emphasis is placed on the services and booking an appointment, while maintaining a cool, understated appearance that is both welcoming and aspiring to clients.

White space and restraint in content saturation plays a big part in a successful web design.
