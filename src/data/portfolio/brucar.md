The **Brucar** website showcases the special features and simplicity of the car hire service. It was designed to pursued users to compare booking fees with the interactive form, and to download the iPhone app for when they require a booking.

The interactive price check form makes use of both Google Maps and the HTML5 geolocation API to reduce user input and provide a visual example of the journey.

Forms should not be difficult or boring to use!
